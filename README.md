## ðŸ”¢ Problem 3: Conditional Odd Number Series

**Description**:  
Given an integer `a`, return a sequence of odd numbers such that:  
- If `a` is odd, generate `a` odd numbers  
- If `a` is even, generate `a - 1` odd numbers  

**Examples**:
- `a = 1` â†’ `1`  
- `a = 2` â†’ `1`  
- `a = 3` â†’ `1, 3, 5`  
- `a = 4` â†’ `1, 3, 5`  
- `a = 5` â†’ `1, 3, 5, 7, 9`
